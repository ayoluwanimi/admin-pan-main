MULTI-PAGE ROTATION FEATURE - DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
===================================================

PRE-DEPLOYMENT
==============
[ ] Read README_ROTATION_FEATURE.md
[ ] Review QUICK_REFERENCE.md
[ ] Backup current working branch
[ ] Verify all test environments available

FRONTEND INTEGRATION
====================
[ ] Copy VisitorManagerEnhanced.jsx → frontend/src/components/admin/VisitorManager.jsx
[ ] Copy VisitorPageEnhanced.jsx → frontend/src/components/VisitorPage.jsx
[ ] Run: npm install (if needed)
[ ] Run: npm start
[ ] Verify no compilation errors
[ ] Check no console warnings
[ ] Test UI loads without errors

BACKEND INTEGRATION
===================
[ ] Verify backend/server.py contains new endpoints
    - Grep for "approve/rotate" - should find endpoint
    - Grep for "rotation/next" - should find endpoint  
    - Grep for "rotation/stop" - should find endpoint
[ ] Verify PageRotationRequest model exists
[ ] Run: python server.py
[ ] Verify no import errors
[ ] Verify no syntax errors
[ ] Check WebSocket endpoints functional

BASIC FUNCTIONALITY TESTS
=========================
[ ] Admin login works
[ ] Visitor table displays
[ ] Single-page approval still works (unchanged)
[ ] Approve button opens modal
[ ] Modal shows "SINGLE PAGE" and "ROTATE (UP TO 6)" tabs
[ ] Can select pages with checkboxes
[ ] Can set rotation interval
[ ] "START ROTATION" button responds
[ ] "APPROVE" button responds (single page mode)

ROTATION FEATURE TESTS
======================
[ ] Can create rotation with 2 pages
[ ] Can create rotation with 6 pages (max)
[ ] Cannot create rotation with 1 page (validation works)
[ ] Cannot create rotation with 7+ pages (validation works)
[ ] Cannot select duplicate pages
[ ] Page counter updates (X/6 shows)
[ ] Interval input accepts 1000-60000ms
[ ] Interval input rejects invalid values

VISITOR SIDE TESTS
==================
[ ] Visitor receives single page correctly
[ ] Visitor receives first page in rotation
[ ] Rotation overlay displays on screen
[ ] Overlay shows page counter (Page X/Y)
[ ] Overlay shows rotation speed (Xs cycle)
[ ] Overlay has orange color (#ff9900)
[ ] Pages auto-advance on schedule
[ ] Page advancement smooth (no flashing)

ADMIN CONTROL TESTS
===================
[ ] Active rotation shows "ROTATING" status in table
[ ] "ROTATING" status has orange indicator
[ ] Skip button (⏩) advances to next page
[ ] Skip button visible during rotation
[ ] Pause button (⏸) stops rotation
[ ] After pause: page freezes (doesn't continue)
[ ] After pause: status changes from "ROTATING" to "APPROVED"
[ ] Can refresh admin page and rotation persists
[ ] Can view other visitors during active rotation

PERSISTENCE TESTS
=================
[ ] Rotation survives page refresh
[ ] Rotation survives WebSocket disconnect
[ ] Rotation survives polling mode fallback
[ ] Admin refresh doesn't interrupt visitor rotation
[ ] Visitor refresh maintains rotation position
[ ] Multiple simultaneous rotations work

PERFORMANCE TESTS
=================
[ ] No CPU spike during rotation
[ ] Memory stable over time
[ ] No memory leaks during rotation
[ ] Smooth transitions at different intervals
[ ] Fast rotation (1000ms) works smooth
[ ] Slow rotation (30000ms) works smooth
[ ] Multiple rotations don't cause lag

COMPATIBILITY TESTS
===================
[ ] Old visitor records work (no new fields required)
[ ] Block/delete still works during rotation
[ ] Logout/login maintains session
[ ] Mobile view displays correctly
[ ] Different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) work
[ ] Different screen sizes work

ERROR HANDLING TESTS
====================
[ ] Invalid page ID shows error
[ ] Invalid interval shows error  
[ ] Network error during rotation handled gracefully
[ ] Missing page content shows fallback
[ ] WebSocket close handled correctly
[ ] Polling fallback activates if WS fails

MONITORING
==========
[ ] Server logs show no errors
[ ] Browser console clean (no warnings)
[ ] Network tab shows successful requests
[ ] WebSocket connection stable
[ ] Database updates logging correctly
[ ] Rotation events logged

DOCUMENTATION
==============
[ ] README_ROTATION_FEATURE.md complete
[ ] QUICK_REFERENCE.md accurate
[ ] INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md tested
[ ] ROTATION_FEATURE_GUIDE.md comprehensive
[ ] IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md complete
[ ] Code comments clear
[ ] Example workflows documented

FINAL VERIFICATION
===================
[ ] All test cases passed
[ ] No regression in existing features
[ ] Performance acceptable
[ ] Security maintained
[ ] Code clean (no debug logs)
[ ] Ready for production

DEPLOYMENT
==========
[ ] Notify team of deployment
[ ] Deploy during maintenance window
[ ] Monitor for 1 hour post-deployment
[ ] Check error logs
[ ] Verify with real users
[ ] Have rollback plan ready

POST-DEPLOYMENT
===============
[ ] Gather user feedback
[ ] Monitor performance metrics
[ ] Watch for error spikes
[ ] Check database for rotation data
[ ] Verify WebSocket stability
[ ] Schedule follow-up review

NOTES
=====
- Test in staging before production
- Keep backups before deployment
- Have rollback procedure ready
- Monitor logs during first week
- Collect admin/visitor feedback
